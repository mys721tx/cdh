            # Automatic vendoring update

            This PR updates the dependencies and vendor directory to reflect
            the latest dependency versions managed by Dependabot.

            ### Changes
            - Updated dependencies in `go.mod`
            - Updated vendor directory

            ### Why?
            When dependencies are updated, the vendor directory requires updating.

            ### Review
            Please review the updated dependencies and vendor directory to ensure
            they're correct and don't break existing functionality.
